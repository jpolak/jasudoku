# Jasudoku

## Introduction

This is a Sudoku solver written in Javascript. It is written in pure Javascript, which means it doesn't use any kind of newfangled Javascript library. The name of the program is a portmanteau of Jason and Sudoku.

## Usage

The entire program is made up of three files: app.js, main.css, and main.html. As long as these files are in the same folder, the program will work. Open main.html in a modern browser and the rest should be self-explanatory.

## Limitations

So far, it limits the total moves to 15000. A few sudoku puzzles take longer than 15000 moves to complete. However, this limitation is in place so the script doesn't overheat my computer. There may also be bugs.

## Future directions

Optimizations will be put in place to reduce the number of moves required, and the styling will be improved.
